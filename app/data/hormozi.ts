This is a real friend of mine. Her entire client acquisition comes from her 5800 Instagram followers. Her average post gets 19 likes and 1 comment. 

Her business? She helps registered dietitians bill insurance correctly. Super niche market. 

She doesn't need 5M followers. She doesn't need to "hack" the algorithm. She understands one simple rule. There is a real person on the other side of those views and treats them that way. Engages with them that way.

No one cares about marriage advice from single people.

Poor people stay poor because they’re afraid of other poor people judging them for trying to get rich.

If it’s hard, good. 

It means no one else will do it.

More for you.

EXAMPLE 3:

“I work a 9 to 5 and I can’t find the time to work on my goals.”

You get 104 days off a year. 

They’re called weekends. 

Use them.

Beginners ask what.

Intermediates ask how.

Experts ask who.

Masters ask why.

EXAMPLE 6:

Sales tactic that directly made me $35,000,000

I had ZERO supplement sales before this interaction at my gym. 

One day this elegant lady walked into one of my presentations. She sits down and starts listening intently.

Me: “Do you want chocolate or vanilla for your protein?” 
Her: “Which one do you like?”

Me: “I prefer chocolate”
Her: “Okay, I’ll take one of those”

Me: “For your pre-workout do you want kiwi or strawberry? I prefer the kiwi” Her: “Okay, I’ll take that one”

Me: “Do you want to use the card you have on file?”
Her: “Yep!”

I remember it like it was yesterday. She grabbed the supplements and walked out of the facility. And there I was, with my FIRST-EVER supplement sale. Here is why this BLEW MY MIND.

I didn’t explain what these supplements did, why they were good for her etc. I just simply asked, which one she wanted. The KEY was I didn’t ask her “whether” she wanted them, I asked “which one” she wanted. That’s when I was introduced to the “Assumed Close”. It’s the biggest upsell in business.
